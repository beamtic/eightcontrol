 *          eightcontrol File Handler
 *
 *        This example can be used to test and debug file-locking on a server.
 *        The file_handler class has build-in errors that can be used for debugging.
 *
 *        You will probably not need to use obtain_lock() manually. This is mainly to test if your server supports file-locking,
 *        and to test if the file is_writable(), which is required for locking to work.
